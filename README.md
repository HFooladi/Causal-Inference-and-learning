# Causal Inference and learning
I have started to learn more about the topic of causal inference and causal learning. Therefore, I have decided to put together here every resource I am using during my journey towards understanding this topic. My interests in this topic span around philosophical notion and argument about causality to the recent trends in the machine learning community for reconciling causal graph with deep learning.

[The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X)

I think reading this book is the best starting point for understanding causality. The book is a combination of the technical report and popular science essay. It is very accessible and at the same time thought-provoking. Maybe it is a good idea, to begin reading [this intreview](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/) and continue by reading the book.

[ML beyond Curve Fitting: An Intro to Causal Inference and do-Calculus](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/)

Ferenc Huszár did a nice job of putting together three tutorials on introducing causal inference and do-calculus. It covers the ladder of causation, from association and observation all the way towards intervention and counterfactuals. I found them very enjoyable reading. I definitely recommend reading this material.

Moreover, there are some videos that accompany this tutorial. [Ferenc Huszár Causal Inference in Everyday Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/HOgx_SBBzn0)


[Constructing the world: Active causal learning in cognition](https://www.bramleylab.ppls.ed.ac.uk/publication/2017-01-01_bramley2017phdthesis/)

Although we are observing a recent trends on reconciling causal inference with machine learning in AI community, but causality has been always one of the major topics in philosophy and psychology. There is a long-standing history and debate on causality and prominant philosophers such as David Hume have spent their carreer on working in this subject. There is a debate about whethr the world is causal or whether we are percivieng and understanding the world as causal. I beiliev that casuality is subjective and there is no such a thing as causal objective world. We are observing the world and inferring causal structure from observation and intervention; i.e., it is a good habit of the mind and can lead to scientific and technological discovery, and as a result, perciving the world in this way has a evolutionary benefits.

Anyways, let is talk about this refernce. Dr Neil Bramley has done a great job on exploring active causal learning in cognition. How human interact with surronding objects and choose appropriate intervention to unveil the causal structures. He has shown that interventional and temporal cues, along with top-down hierarchical constraints, inform the gradual evolution and adaptation of increasingly rich causal representations.

I recommend reading this Thesis to all the people who are interestd in psychology and also reinforcment learning.
